**REQUIREMENTS:**
+ On Android, you must have VLC or any other video player that can play .m3u8 files installed. 
+ On Windows, VLC is recommended, but other video players can be used. Note that *ONLY VLC* can autoselect subtitles on Windows, on other video players, and on Android, you have to do that manually.

**CANT PLAY VIDEO?**
+ Make sure that you have installed VLC, or any other video player if you are running Windows.
+ If you can't play any movie, make sure to link the .m3u8 filetype to a video player. On Android you have to go to file manager and open the mirrorlist.m3u8 file that CloudStream 2 generated as a video file. You can do this on Windows by creating a .txt file and renaming it to example.m3u8, then right click and open with VLC.

***How it works:***

This app dosen't use a p2p connection or any private servers hosted by me, **IT IS NOT A BITTORRENT**. It takes all the links from established streaming sites by downloading the sites and extracting the useful information.

CloudStream and CloudStream 2 works in diffrent ways. CloudStream gets the links and info from the link site directly. CloudStream 2 will first search IMDb and then crossreference with the link sites and MAL to get the links. This will result in CloudStream 2 having fewer providers overall, and sometimes having links to diffrent movies or shows with the same name. It will also make CloudStream 2 slower because it has to download many more sites to get all the information.
